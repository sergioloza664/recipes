<h1>Full English Breakfast</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    "The English breakfast (also called full English breakfast, full monty or fry-up) is a hearty and filling breakfast
    traditionally consisted of sausages, fried eggs, grilled tomatoes, beans (baked beans), bacon, mushrooms and
    buttered toast. Often you will also find white or black pudding (English blood sausage) as well as hash browns.
    Whilst it is commonly referred to as a "full English breakfast", in the various regions of Great Britain and Ireland
    it is also named according to the region i.e. "full Scottish", "full Welsh", "full Irish" etc. You can also find
    regional variations of this classic breakfast: In Scotland, for example, "tattie scones" (a kind of potato pancake)
    and haggis are served, while the Welsh people enjoy their breakfast with "laverbread" (a seaweed dish). All of this
    is often accompanied by coffee, tea or orange juice. The breakfast can also be made vegetarian or vegan. Simply
    replace sausages, bacon and butter with plant-based alternatives. For a vegan version, either omit the egg or
    prepare scrambled eggs with an egg substitute."

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Preheat the oven to 100 °C/212 °F on top/bottom heat. Slowly heat the baked beans in a small saucepan and keep
        warm on low. Meanwhile, wash and quarter the mushrooms. Halve the tomatoes horizontally. Heat some oil in a
        large pan and fry the mushrooms on all sides for approx. 6 min. over high heat. Place mushrooms in an ovenproof
        pan and keep warm in the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat oil again in the same pan and fry the tomatoes for approx. 3 min. on each side. Remove the tomato halves
        from the pan and add to the mushrooms in the oven and keep warm.
    </li>
    <li>
        Wipe out the pan and heat oil again. Add bacon and fry for approx. 4–6 min. until bacon is crispy. Keep the
        bacon warm in the oven. Discard excess oil or use it to fry the sausages. Remove skin from blood sausages. Fry
        the bratwurst and blood sausages together for approx. 4 min. until crispy and golden brown. Keep the contents of
        the pan warm in the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour away the fat and wipe out the pan. Fry the eggs in the same pan. Meanwhile, toast the sandwich bread until
        golden brown. Then cut in half crossways to form triangles. Spread toast with some butter. Arrange all
        ingredients side by side on a large plate.
